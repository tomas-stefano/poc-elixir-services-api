* Implement JWT
* Implement locale (en is the default. Implement Cy). Also locale search
* Verify all the routes and see where I forgot to add the created_at/updated_at

* Test more and see if I forgot anything.
* Test with real data (real metadata).
* Test DB performance to see if I forgot any indexes.
* Migrations needs to run in the docker. Why it doesn't work? ¬¬'
